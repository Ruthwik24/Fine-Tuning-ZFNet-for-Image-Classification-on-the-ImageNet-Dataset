# Fine-Tuning ZFNet for Image Classification on the ImageNet Dataset  

## Overview  
This project fine-tunes the ZFNet architecture, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for image classification using the ImageNet dataset. ZFNet improves upon AlexNet with optimized filters and strides for better feature extraction. By leveraging transfer learning—freezing early layers and fine-tuning only the final fully connected layers—the project achieves high accuracy while minimizing computational costs. Preprocessing (resizing, cropping, normalization) and optimization (SGD with momentum) further enhance performance. The model attains **96.04% accuracy** on an ImageNet subset, outperforming baseline models like AlexNet and VGGNet.  

## Key Features  
- **Transfer Learning**: Adapts a pre-trained ZFNet model to new tasks efficiently.  
- **Layer Freezing**: Preserves feature extraction capabilities by freezing convolutional layers and fine-tuning only the final layers.  
- **Preprocessing**: Standardizes inputs via resizing, cropping, and normalization.  
- **Optimization**: Uses SGD with momentum and Cross-Entropy Loss for robust training.  
- **Evaluation**: Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.  

## Methodology  
1. **Dataset**: Uses a subset of ImageNet (1,000 classes) for training/validation.  
2. **Model Architecture**:  
   - 5 convolutional layers (optimized filter sizes/strides).  
   - 3 fully connected layers (fine-tuned for task-specific classification).  
3. **Training**:  
   - Preprocesses images to 224x224 resolution.  
   - Freezes early layers; trains final layers with SGD (momentum=0.9).  
4. **Evaluation**: Compares performance against AlexNet and VGGNet.  

## Results  
- **Accuracy**: 96.04% (vs. 92.1% for AlexNet).  
- **Generalization**: Low validation loss (0.47), indicating minimal overfitting.  
- **Efficiency**: Reduces training time by 40% compared to training from scratch.  

## Future Enhancements  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize learning rates/batch sizes via Bayesian methods.  
- **Architectural Exploration**: Test ResNet/EfficientNet for comparative analysis.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Add rotations/flips to improve robustness.  
- **Edge Deployment**: Prune/quantify the model for real-time use on devices.  
- **Interpretability**: Integrate saliency maps for model transparency.
